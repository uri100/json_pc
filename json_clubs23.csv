Recruitment was, and still is, based on the model whereby a candidate member must be proposed and seconded by two existing Members, and subsequently approved by the Admissions Committee. The club has 10 private function rooms that can hold from 10 to 100 people.

The prestigious Hotel Milano Scala will also be home to a club house that takes its cue from the age-old English tradition of gentlemen’s clubs. This is indeed the inspiration behind the founding concept of DO7 Eco Club House, whose name offers a nod to the club’s strategic location in via Dell’Orso 7, as well as a playful allusion to the musical chord Do7, acknowledging the history (and position) of the hotel. The club aims to cater to those who come to Milan city centre regularly or who need the right location to meet clients or friends during the day. Professionals and business people, but also companies large or small looking for a venue guaranteed to impress, or simply a go-to place where they can develop business opportunities, but also enjoy some well-deserved leisure time. Alongside the services you’d expect of an English private members’ club – cloakroom and changing room, modular spaces for private meetings or corporate events, social tables for informal gatherings, events and evenings reserved for members – the Club offers hotel services such as a 24/7 reception, concierge services, bedrooms for daytime use and an automated garage. Networking will be high on the agenda for DO7 Eco Club House, with tailor-made activities and events designed to help members create and expand their networking contacts. Club members will be able to enjoy their leisure time by sipping a cocktail in the Lounge Bar, savouring one of the modern, sophisticated dishes served in the restaurant, or perhaps consulting the concierge for a tailor-made experience.

The clubhouse is the Hôtel Perrinet de Jars at 33 rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré in Paris, France. It adjoins the British Embassy and an annex of the embassy of Japan. Because of its very central Paris address (a stone throw from the Place de la Concorde), its majestic interiors and its beautiful French gardens, the clubhouse is often considered as one of the most beautiful if not the most prestigious in France. The club's second president was Ferdinand Foch, Marshal of France, Field Marshal of the United Kingdom, Marshal of Poland and supreme commander of the Allies of World War I. The club includes royalty and political figures among its international members. The sports facility offers a 25m (5 lanes) swimming pool, squash courts, saunas, hammam, gym and training rooms, and is completed with a casual restaurant overlooking the swimming pool. A formal club dining room on the 1st floor and out in the garden during the summer months complete this club's amenities.",+33 1 42 65 96 00,4.7,586

Two years later, the Club adopted navy blue and red as its corporate colours: navy blue for sportsmanship and red for the brotherhood of man in sports. By 1904, with increasing membership, construction of a Clubhouse commenced, with the foundation stone laid by President Mr Edwin Tessensohn. The Clubhouse was formally opened on 2 September 1905, the Governor of Singapore, Sir John Anderson. The addition of two wings was completed in 1931 and declared open by President Dr Noel Clarke. In 1963, Ordinary membership of the Club was opened to people of all communities in Singapore. With this substantial pool of multi-racial and multi-talented members, SRC established a forceful presence in the sporting arena since its early days. History was made again on 28 June 1997 when the current Clubhouse was unveiled at a grand opening ceremony officiated by Dr Tony Tan, then Deputy Prime Minister of Singapore and Minister of Defence.

The small port founded by Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles, the founder of Singapore, developed into a thriving trading centre, and the everyday life of the British settlement had become more sophisticated, and exclusively European. In October 1865, ""forty good men and true"" convened a meeting for the purpose of forming a suburban social club to meet the wants of the British living in the settlement, and founded the Tanglin Club. A property in the District of Claymore was purchased in 1866 and this is the current site of the Tanglin Club today. For many years, the Tanglin Club was one of the pillars of social life in Singapore for successful members of the European community. By the late 1930s, its ballroom had the reputation of having the best dance floor in the island and the Club band was a focal point of attraction. The highlight of Singapore's social calendar was The Tanglin Ball. Even today, the ball is held yearly in the Churchill Room, an icon of the Club. Squash and tennis are also synonymous with The Tanglin Club. Before the fall of Singapore in February 1942, the Club was prepared for use as a convalescent depot for the Malayan Armed Service and an evacuee centre. During the Japanese occupation the Club was used as a Japanese officers' club. Having survived the vicissitudes of debt and war, age and apathy, even a major transformation, the Tanglin Club still retains an aura of exclusivity as one of the premier social clubs in Singapore today.Having grown from ""Forty Good Men"" to over 4,000 Members, the Club prides itself on itternational and cosmopolitan nature with more than 70 nationalities among its Members.

Thankfully (in 2005), two senior members of Telok Blangah Community Centre (now renamed as Telok Blangah Community Club), Mr Richard Yip and Mr Frankie Yat, got together and decided to do a total rejuvenation of the club. Its range was at a field next to the (now non-existent) Telok Blangah Primary School and a stone's throw from its present range for a fairly long time, until 2012 when it moved over. A funny thing was that its early members were somehow largely made up of retirees and fairly senior working people. The archery fraternity often teased that it was the Old Men's Archery Club. Soon, the teasing stopped when in under 2 years, the Club began to make a strong mark in local competitions. Indeed, we take pride that a significant number of our members are part of the Singapore National Archery Team and are also thankful for the continued support from the Telok Blangah Community Club. Several of the early members are still with the club. They include, of course, our two rejuvenators, Richard who is now the Advisor and â€śUncle Frankieâ€ť who is the Chairman as well as JL, our famed Mama cum National Archer cum Treasurer. Don Quixote and Decrepit who are now traditional bow archers with the Eagles sub-group were also early members of the club. For a bit of local history and trivia, the name â€śTelok Blangahâ€ť means â€śClay Pot Bayâ€ť in Malay. (Telok = Bay; Blangah = Clay pot or cauldron). The modern Malay spelling would be Teluk Belanga. Much of the area used to belong to the Yeo's Association and was the subject of land acquisition by the Singapore Government in the early 1970s, for the purpose of public housing. Due to it's proximity to the southern shore, Telok Blangah was designated as a resettlement housing estate for many island dwellers from the Southern islands. In fact, you could buy fresh sea catch from the early resettlement provision stores as the former islanders would still frequent their old fishing grounds. However, this practice stopped within a matter of years as access to the sea became more difficult and with the urbanization of the resettled communities. Today, the Yeo's Association (now called Hokkien Yeo See Association) still own about a 1+ hectare plot for their association building, just a few hops from our archery club.",,,

Cotton with Frank Pennink laid out the original 18 holes at Olgiata Golf Club, one of several Italian courses that he designed or restyled in the 1960s. A second nine holes have since been incorporated into the same large estate that lies to the north of the capital. The property was once a stud farm, producing world class thoroughbreds – like Nearco in the 1930s and Ribot in the 1950s – and a horse racing track still exists to the south of this massive golf and residential complex. All 27 holes at Olgiata are set in sumptuous parkland surroundings where the terrain is mildly undulating and fairways are separated by avenues of magnificent mature trees. The two 9-hole loops of the West course fan out from the clubhouse in opposite directions with many of the well-bunkered holes gently doglegging left or right. The club co-hosted the Italian Open with Roma Acquasanta in 1973. More recently, Ian Poulter claimed the Italian Open title here in 2002 and Bernd Wiesberger prevailed in 2019. The club has twice hosted the World Cup; the first time in 1968 when the Canadian two-man team of Al Balding and George Knudson lifted the trophy; and the second occasion in 1984, with the Spanish winners from two years previous, José Maria Cańizares and José Rivero, triumphing again.",+39 06 3088 9141,4.5,638

The residence, originally commissioned by Cardinal Flavio Chigi, is now considered the most charming club house among golf clubs; the crater, thanks to the creative flair of Robert Trent Jones Sr., has been transformed into a challenging golf course, full of intriguing technical features. The naturally laid ground has been endowed with one hundred and one tricks among centenarian olive trees, oaks and cluster pines. The balcony of the club house offers a fascinating and complete panorama of the course: the 18 holes can be embraced in a single look, giving the feeling of an intimate and evocative atmosphere, while four centuries of history provide protection within the walls of the club house and the seafront shines in the background. In the charming halls as well as on the delightful garden of the terrace takes place the performance of our chef of the restaurant, whose recipes of revisited regional cuisine fulfill the gusto of every guest.",+39 06 931 2301,4.5,383

After the clubhouse was built, in 1984, the construction of the course and driving Range started to take place. In 1990 the club celebrates its 18th holes’ course opening, thoughtfully improved over the following years. Eventually it became one of the most pleasing and suggestive courses in Rome. In such a short time Fioranello Golf Club builds its success on its standards and image, thanks to the course and club’s design, which reflect the true spirit of the countryside golf club, the original British vision of the Golf Club. A precise identity, that evokes a unique atmosphere, hard to find in the clubs of the Capitol.

Emerging in post-WWI Italy, the club fostered rowing, inspired by British tradition, and quickly became a hub for sports and social life along the Tiber. Over the decades, it evolved into one of Italy’s premier sports clubs, expanding its facilities to include rowing, tennis, paddle, football, and even cultural activities. Its legacy includes national and international titles in rowing, canoeing, and tennis, with a significant membership growth from just over 100 in 1922 to 1,000 today. The club’s infrastructure now boasts state-of-the-art equipment, including a fleet of 50 boats, a floating dock, gyms, and multiple courts. Competitive rivalries, particularly with Canottieri Lazio, and iconic figures like Nicola Pietrangeli have enriched its history. Honored with the CONI Golden Star for Sporting Merit in 1971, the club remains a vibrant hub where generations engage in sports, leisure, and cultural events, solidifying its role as a cornerstone of Roman sports tradition.",+39 06 361 2921,4.5,351
