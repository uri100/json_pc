Our private floor has three rehearsal rooms, three Steinway pianos, a pool table, a writer’s nook, our legendary art collection, comfy chairs, free high-speed WiFi, library, script library, and 24/7 access. We share the building with other clubs, so our use of other floors and the bar-restaurant is shared space.",
