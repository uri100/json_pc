Trophies, period photos and significant memorabilia, testify inside the colonial-style clubhouse, not only to the intense sporting activity of the club members but also, over the course of seventy years of activity, the presence of a group of passionate spectators of absolute respect. The club has a competition field and a training field, stables, sand and round tracks, changing rooms, an excellent restaurant and a splendid swimming pool surrounded by greenery. Courses are held for beginners or improvement for players. In the month of June, night tournaments are held, considered among the most evocative in Italy.",

    "description": "The Foreign Affairs Club, established in 1936 to represent the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, still maintains a strong international vocation and contributes to the institutional and representational activities of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation by hosting official ceremonies and offering its facilities as an elegant venue for both formal and informal business meetings. Large halls and representative spaces, bridge rooms, a pool table and television, restaurant, cafeteria, and a café are all available at the club. The practise of sports activities is an important part of the offerings of the Foreign Affairs Club, which are popular with members of all ages: swimming, gym, fitness room, tennis, rowing, running, five-a-side football, table tennis, and sport climbing. Furthermore, we are building a cutting-edge padel court. Solid is also the club’s cultural tradition, which offers a broad array of musical, literary, artistic, as well as scientific events. Its mission is endorsed, however, by the considerable exhibition space dedicated to contemporary art. The prestigious art collection on exhibit in the club’s internal spaces absolutely differentiates it as “unique” in the landscape of Roman clubs. Dancing parties, theme nights, charity events, bridge courses, and buraco tournaments all contribute to the generous social activities program. Please feel free to contact the secretariat if you require any further information concerning guests’ and members’ admittance. The Foreign Affairs Club is located on the Tiber’s left bank in Lungotevere dell’Acqua Acetosa 42, a true haven of peace and nature amidst the noise of urban traffic and the frenetic rhythms of life in a capital. We especially recommend reading “Il Circolo del Ministero degli Affari Esteri” by Ugo Colombo Sacco di Albiano, Publisher Gangemi, pp. 287, Rome 2008 for an exhaustive look at the club history.",

Starting from September 2023, the Club moved to its new headquarters, in Palazzo Altieri, in Piazza del Gesů, 49. Palazzo Altieri, one of the most important and significant examples of Roman Baroque, occupies a large block in the center of the city between the Pantheon and Piazza Venezia, overlooking Via del Plebiscito and Piazza del Gesů with its main facade. Commissioned by Cardinal Giovanni Battista Altieri to the architect Giovanni Antonio De Rossi, the palace was built starting in 1650 on a nucleus of medieval origin. It was then further expanded between 1670 and 1673, at the behest of Pope Clement X and under the control of his cardinal nephew, Paluzzo Paluzzi Altieri degli Albertoni. The second noble floor, now home to the Nuovo Circolo degli Scacchi, has become representative of the entire Palace over time due to its rich and refined furnishings and valuable decorations.",

    "description": "The Societŕ Ginnastica dei Canottieri del Tevere – today the Reale Circolo Canottieri Tevere Remo – was formally founded in 1872. The Society, which was the first to introduce gymnastics and rowing to Rome, had a clear Risorgimento vocation, so much so that after the annexation of Rome to the Kingdom of Italy, it received high recognition from the Royal House of Savoy and the highest authorities of the government. Among these recognitions is the membership, since its foundation as honorary members, of Prince Tommaso of Savoy, Duke of Genoa, brother of the future Queen Margherita, of the Minister of the Navy at the time, Admiral Benedetto Brin, and of the Mayor of the Capital. Before the establishment of the Royal Yacht Club of Italy (RYCI) in 1879, in which the Club participated directly, the Societŕ Ginnastica dei Canottieri del Tevere set up a sailing base in Palo Laziale, on the estate of Prince Ladislao Odescalchi, founder of the town of Ladispoli and second President, after Guglielmo Grant, of the Society. In 1912, with the merger with the Circolo del Remo, the base was transferred to Anzio where it is still in full operation. The club has a long history in the field of competitive rowing and sailing and has won many titles, medals and trophies since 1875; many of them are on display in the Palazzina della Sede Sociale.",

A second nine holes have since been incorporated into the same large estate that lies to the north of the capital. The property was once a stud farm, producing world class thoroughbreds – like Nearco in the 1930s and Ribot in the 1950s – and a horse racing track still exists to the south of this massive golf and residential complex. All 27 holes at Olgiata are set in sumptuous parkland surroundings where the terrain is mildly undulating and fairways are separated by avenues of magnificent mature trees. The two 9-hole loops of the West course fan out from the clubhouse in opposite directions with many of the well-bunkered holes gently doglegging left or right. The club co-hosted the Italian Open with Roma Acquasanta in 1973. More recently, Ian Poulter claimed the Italian Open title here in 2002 and Bernd Wiesberger prevailed in 2019. The club has twice hosted the World Cup; the first time in 1968 when the Canadian two-man team of Al Balding and George Knudson lifted the trophy; and the second occasion in 1984, with the Spanish winners from two years previous, José Maria Cańizares and José Rivero, triumphing again.",

    "description": "A mansion built in the seventeenth century overlooks the crater of an extinct volcano. The residence, originally commissioned by Cardinal Flavio Chigi, is now considered the most charming club house among golf clubs; the crater, thanks to the creative flair of Robert Trent Jones Sr., has been transformed into a challenging golf course, full of intriguing technical features. The naturally laid ground has been endowed with one hundred and one tricks among centenarian olive trees, oaks and cluster pines. The balcony of the club house offers a fascinating and complete panorama of the course: the 18 holes can be embraced in a single look, giving the feeling of an intimate and evocative atmosphere, while four centuries of history provide protection within the walls of the club house and the seafront shines in the background. In the charming halls as well as on the delightful garden of the terrace takes place the performance of our chef of the restaurant, whose recipes of revisited regional cuisine fulfill the gusto of every guest.",

    "description": "Fioranello Golf Club was founded in 1979 in the evocative Roman countryside, once belonged to the household of the Princes Boncompagni Ludovisi, at the borders of the archeological park of Appia Antica. After the clubhouse was built, in 1984, the construction of the course and driving Range started to take place. In 1990 the club celebrates its 18th holes’ course opening, thoughtfully improved over the following years. Eventually it became one of the most pleasing and suggestive courses in Rome. In such a short time Fioranello Golf Club builds its success on its standards and image, thanks to the course and club’s design, which reflect the true spirit of the countryside golf club, the original British vision of the Golf Club. A precise identity, that evokes a unique atmosphere, hard to find in the clubs of the Capitol. The social life, sport and wellness, in their best functionality and environment, without “pricey/posh” demands, but still giving off the “Old English” vibes. Our Club definitely outstands for these aspects, and charm our guests to discover it for the first time.",

    "description": "Founded on September 28, 1919, the Circolo Canottieri Roma began with modest expenses for its first yellow-red flag and a rented riverside location. Emerging in post-WWI Italy, the club fostered rowing, inspired by British tradition, and quickly became a hub for sports and social life along the Tiber. Over the decades, it evolved into one of Italy’s premier sports clubs, expanding its facilities to include rowing, tennis, padel, football, and even cultural activities. Its legacy includes national and international titles in rowing, canoeing, and tennis, with a significant membership growth from just over 100 in 1922 to 1,000 today. The club’s infrastructure now boasts state-of-the-art equipment, including a fleet of 50 boats, a floating dock, gyms, and multiple courts. Competitive rivalries, particularly with Canottieri Lazio, and iconic figures like Nicola Pietrangeli have enriched its history. Honored with the CONI Golden Star for Sporting Merit in 1971, the club remains a vibrant hub where generations engage in sports, leisure, and cultural events, solidifying its role as a cornerstone of Roman sports tradition.",
