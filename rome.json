Trophies, period photos and significant memorabilia, testify inside the colonial-style clubhouse, not only to the intense sporting activity of the club members but also, over the course of seventy years of activity, the presence of a group of passionate spectators of absolute respect. The club has a competition field and a training field, stables, sand and round tracks, changing rooms, an excellent restaurant and a splendid swimming pool surrounded by greenery. Courses are held for beginners or improvement for players. In the month of June, night tournaments are held, considered among the most evocative in Italy.",

    "description": "The Foreign Affairs Club, established in 1936 to represent the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, still maintains a strong international vocation and contributes to the institutional and representational activities of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation by hosting official ceremonies and offering its facilities as an elegant venue for both formal and informal business meetings. Large halls and representative spaces, bridge rooms, a pool table and television, restaurant, cafeteria, and a café are all available at the club. The practise of sports activities is an important part of the offerings of the Foreign Affairs Club, which are popular with members of all ages: swimming, gym, fitness room, tennis, rowing, running, five-a-side football, table tennis, and sport climbing. Furthermore, we are building a cutting-edge padel court. Solid is also the club’s cultural tradition, which offers a broad array of musical, literary, artistic, as well as scientific events. Its mission is endorsed, however, by the considerable exhibition space dedicated to contemporary art. The prestigious art collection on exhibit in the club’s internal spaces absolutely differentiates it as “unique” in the landscape of Roman clubs. Dancing parties, theme nights, charity events, bridge courses, and buraco tournaments all contribute to the generous social activities program. Please feel free to contact the secretariat if you require any further information concerning guests’ and members’ admittance. The Foreign Affairs Club is located on the Tiber’s left bank in Lungotevere dell’Acqua Acetosa 42, a true haven of peace and nature amidst the noise of urban traffic and the frenetic rhythms of life in a capital. We especially recommend reading “Il Circolo del Ministero degli Affari Esteri” by Ugo Colombo Sacco di Albiano, Publisher Gangemi, pp. 287, Rome 2008 for an exhaustive look at the club history.",

Starting from September 2023, the Club moved to its new headquarters, in Palazzo Altieri, in Piazza del Gesù, 49. Palazzo Altieri, one of the most important and significant examples of Roman Baroque, occupies a large block in the center of the city between the Pantheon and Piazza Venezia, overlooking Via del Plebiscito and Piazza del Gesù with its main facade. Commissioned by Cardinal Giovanni Battista Altieri to the architect Giovanni Antonio De Rossi, the palace was built starting in 1650 on a nucleus of medieval origin. It was then further expanded between 1670 and 1673, at the behest of Pope Clement X and under the control of his cardinal nephew, Paluzzo Paluzzi Altieri degli Albertoni. The second noble floor, now home to the Nuovo Circolo degli Scacchi, has become representative of the entire Palace over time due to its rich and refined furnishings and valuable decorations.",

    "description": "The Società Ginnastica dei Canottieri del Tevere – today the Reale Circolo Canottieri Tevere Remo – was formally founded in 1872. The Society, which was the first to introduce gymnastics and rowing to Rome, had a clear Risorgimento vocation, so much so that after the annexation of Rome to the Kingdom of Italy, it received high recognition from the Royal House of Savoy and the highest authorities of the government. Among these recognitions is the membership, since its foundation as honorary members, of Prince Tommaso of Savoy, Duke of Genoa, brother of the future Queen Margherita, of the Minister of the Navy at the time, Admiral Benedetto Brin, and of the Mayor of the Capital. Before the establishment of the Royal Yacht Club of Italy (RYCI) in 1879, in which the Club participated directly, the Società Ginnastica dei Canottieri del Tevere set up a sailing base in Palo Laziale, on the estate of Prince Ladislao Odescalchi, founder of the town of Ladispoli and second President, after Guglielmo Grant, of the Society. In 1912, with the merger with the Circolo del Remo, the base was transferred to Anzio where it is still in full operation. The club has a long history in the field of competitive rowing and sailing and has won many titles, medals and trophies since 1875; many of them are on display in the Palazzina della Sede Sociale.",
