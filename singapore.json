In 1997, the Sports Complex was added offering bowling, badminton, tennis, a fully equipped gym, dance studio and others. The Brass Kitten is a new addition to the Sports Complex offering mixed drinks from the golden age of cocktails. The main building, the Clubhouse, houses The Veranda Lounge and The Deck Bar, 15 Superior rooms, 2 Superior Deluxe rooms and a spacious Suite, function rooms, BBQ Hot Pot buffet restaurant and the enticing Olympic-sized swimming pool that overlooks the sea. Changi Beach Club is indeed blessed with numerous assets, and one of its most enduring is that it is the only Club in Singapore with a useable beach front. You can have your BBQ parties with the waves gently lapping at your feet! Yes, your own truly private beach party! Changi Beach Club aims to be a unique resort, far from the bustle of city life, promising you fun, romantic and unforgettable moments.",

When peace was declared in 1945 the British Army went back into the Changi site and stayed there until 1946 when the administration and running of the base was handed over to the Royal Air Force. The RAF Changi personnel decided to create a golf section and they laid out a few holes on the sports field without any bunkers. It was not until 1949 that the golf course was ready for play. The clubhouse facilities include a Chinese restaurant, golfers' lounge, golfers' terrace, function room, card room and karaoke room. The clubhouse overlooks the Changi beach which offers a panoramic view of the sea and Pulau Ubin. Changi is one of the few remaining places in modern Singapore that still retains an idyllic environment.",

From Beach Catamarans to Platus, rentals of various dinghies and keelboats for leisure and competitive use are available. Regular Sailing Courses with relevant certifications, conducted by our qualified and experienced instructors, are open to members and non-members alike. At CSC, there are activities for all ages! There is a variety of competitive and social events which are permanent features on our calendar. Some of the key events are: the annual Ambassadors' Cup, Commodore's Cup, New Year's Eve Party, CSC Optimist Championships and various National Regattas. We have our active weekend Sunday Series & Saturday Twilights, Monthly Dinghy Races, Members' Night and regular social-in-the-city organised exclusively for members. In addition, the club has an ongoing Sailing Programme for schools, and is an ideal location for customised team-building and corporate events.",

    "description": "Chui Huay Lim Club was founded in 1845 during the Qing Dynasty period and is one of the oldest clubs in Singapore. During the early days, it was popularly known as the \"Teochew Gentlemen's Club.\" Chui Huay Lim Club played a unique role in early Chinese society. During the colonial period, it was a meeting place where local Teochews gathered to exchange ideas. Prominent local Teochews played a pivotal role in the Teochew Community, enhancing its reputation. The late Tan Cheng Bao saw the need for a social venue for Teochews when the community was growing and prospering. Hence, Tan Cheng Bao initiated the idea and successfully founded Chui Huay Lim Club in temporary premises at 190 Kee Lam Road. In 1879, with the passing of Tan Cheng Bao, 10 members Chen Yongxi, Wang Zheliu, Wu Hedi, Chen Yaliang, She Zhiqiang, Zhuang Zhenhao, Lu Laos, Chen Mingke, He Ruiju, Huang Jinran donated $4000 to purchase the land from the Tan family. These 10 people thus became Chui Huay Lim Club's trustees.",

    "description": "Established on 25th October 1971, the Singapore Civil Service Sports Council (SCSSC) was originally created to oversee inter-territorial games between Civil Servants of Singapore and Malaysia. The Tanglin Clubhouse, located on Dempsey Road, became the official home of SCSSC in April 1972. During this time, the council began organizing a diverse range of sports activities for public service officers. Although the facilities were modest back then, the vision of promoting sports, fitness, and recreational activities among Public Officers was clear and unwavering; to promote a healthy lifestyle in the Public Service. As the years went by, the SCSSC transformed into the Civil Service Club (CSC) that exists today - a vibrant community where camaraderie, recreation, and well-being thrive. The Civil Service Club serves as the home club for public service officers and is the organizing body for the STAR Games, an annual series of competitive sports played by representatives from different ministries and statutory boards. These games foster friendly competition, and serve as a platform for networking and camaraderie among public service officers. Beyond its role in sports and fitness, the Club values the well-being and fulfillment of public service officers and their families - be it for family bonding activities, exploring new hobbies, or forging meaningful connections with like-minded individuals, the Club offers a wide range of activities and events catering to all age groups and interests.",

The club was officially opened in March 1994 as SAFRA Resort & Country Club. It was later renamed National Service Resort & Country Club (NSRCC) to better reflect the composition of its membership that comprises NSmen from the Army, Navy, Air force, Civil Defence and the Police Force. Members enjoy two clubs for the price of one. NSRCC offers an 18-hole championship course with full clubhouse facilities at NSRCC Changi and an 18-hole golf course at NSRCC Kranji.",

Macey and some residents of Serangoon Gardens, it was then known as the Serangoon Gardens Sports Club. Membership was just $2 but was exclusive to residents of Serangoon Gardens estate. Majority were British servicemen who enjoyed gathering at the Club for soccer and hockey matches or a game of billiards, darts, bridge or tombola. Children also had a splashing time when the soccer field occasionally doubled-up as a pool and fishing pond after heavy rain. Today, the Club boasts a strong heritage of patrons such as Mr. George Yeo, Mrs. Lim Hwee Hua and Member of Parliament for Aljunied GRC, Ms Sylvia Lim. The Club also prides itself as a Members' Club. This means members have voting rights and own a part of the property and assets of the Club. However, much more than that is the friendship, the relationship, the camaraderie and the sense of belonging formed at Serangoon Gardens Country Club. They are truly priceless and for a lifetime. Indeed, it's a privilege to belong.",

    "description": "Established in 1852, the Singapore Cricket Club is the premier sports and lifestyle club in the heart of the city. The club is a gazetted building framed by a breathtaking blend of historic and modern buildings, with the iconic Padang field at its doorstep. Across time, has been a magnet for Singapore's sporting fraternity. Here, just about every popular field game is played: from cricket, naturally, to soccer, hockey, rugby, tennis, lawn bowls, netball among others.To accommodate its ever-increasing number of sports enthusiasts, the SCC has leased another field in the Dempsey district. Across its two fields, the Club plays host to sports at all levels â€“ from friendlies to interclub and national leagues, as well as international signature tournaments that bring in big name teams. The latter includes the SCC International Hockey 6s, the SCC International Rugby 7s, SCC Cricket Twenty20 and SCC International Soccer7s. The camaraderie built on the field extends to the Clubhouse where wining, dining and socializing facilities cater to a diverse and distinctive community of members. The Club is reputed for its fine dining and local fare options, topped with impeccable and personalised service. All this in venues that have been refurbished with great care to retain its architectural splendour dating back to the colonial era. The Clubhouse's compact size is played to advantage, closely integrating its members and allowing for social and business networking. The Main Lounge is popular for afternoon teas, after-work drinks at its iconic long bar, and after-dinner conversations. The more casual Stumps attracts the sporty for its screening of live matches from around the world and drinks on the Terrace. The Padang Restaurant offers haute cuisine by the Club's own resident chef, while the Oval & Verandah is the place to go for popular local favourites, pizza, and Indian dishes. The Club's packed calendar of events is reflective of its mix of members â€“ celebrating Singapore's many festivals, commemorating milestone events and creating events that bring friends and families together. The story of the Singapore Cricket Club is a fascinating microcosm of the story of Singapore itself. The club's transition from an elite, colonial sports club to an open, multi-racial club playing a leading role in both the sporting and social life of the wider community mirrors changes in the nation as a whole.",

    "description": "The Singapore Recreation Club (SRC) was founded on 23 June 1883 by a group of thirty Eurasian men and was officially established on 1 July 1883. At that time, the Club was housed in a building on Waterloo Street. In 1884, a Pavilion was erected on the site of the Padang allocated to the Club. Two years later, the Club adopted navy blue and red as its corporate colours: navy blue for sportsmanship and red for the brotherhood of man in sports. By 1904, with increasing membership, construction of a Clubhouse commenced, with the foundation stone laid by President Mr Edwin Tessensohn. The Clubhouse was formally opened on 2 September 1905, the Governor of Singapore, Sir John Anderson. The addition of two wings was completed in 1931 and declared open by President Dr Noel Clarke. In 1963, Ordinary membership of the Club was opened to people of all communities in Singapore. With this substantial pool of multi-racial and multi-talented members, SRC established a forceful presence in the sporting arena since its early days. History was made again on 28 June 1997 when the current Clubhouse was unveiled at a grand opening ceremony officiated by Dr Tony Tan, then Deputy Prime Minister of Singapore and Minister of Defence. The objectives of the Club remain: to promote all forms of sports, recreation and social activities through an active calendar of events, as well as to participate in activities of national sports association and the Singapore National Olympic Council. The commitment to sporting excellence is enshrined in the Club's Constitution and prevails to the present day.",

The GUESTHOUSE with its nicely appointed rooms offers comfortable accommodation for visitors in a natural setting. The RIFLE LOUNGE in the Clubhouse and the conference rooms at the PAVILION can be rented for private and corporate events.

The fine fairways of TMCC golf courses have also been the welcome carpet that have beguiled golf greats, dignitaries, and celebrities. In 1978, the ad hoc Committee of TMCC was formed to determine golf course designers and Clubhouse architects. This landmark meeting was a significant milestone that paved the way for the formation of the Pro-Tem Management Committee in 1980, with the aim to manage the development of the Club course and facilities. Since its official opening in 1984, the Club has played host to several premiere events including the Singapore Open, Johnnie Walker Classic, Tiger Skins, Lexus Cup and the HSBC Women's Champions. Strategically located on Singapore's East Coast nestled among acres of open fairways and picturesque greenery, TMCC is also home to a luxurious Clubhouse, an Olympic-size swimming pool, tennis and squash courts, as well as four F&B outlets with over 220 dedicated staff. The suite of premier facilities, coupled with TMCC's two distinguished golf courses, ensure members and guests experience a standard attained by only the finest of such establishments in the region.",

    "description": "The opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 and the advent of steamers resulted in a travel revolution. The small port founded by Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles, the founder of Singapore, developed into a thriving trading centre, and the everyday life of the British settlement had become more sophisticated, and exclusively European. In October 1865, \"forty good men and true\" convened a meeting for the purpose of forming a suburban social club to meet the wants of the British living in the settlement, and founded the Tanglin Club. A property in the District of Claymore was purchased in 1866 and this is the current site of the Tanglin Club today. For many years, the Tanglin Club was one of the pillars of social life in Singapore for successful members of the European community. By the late 1930s, its ballroom had the reputation of having the best dance floor in the island and the Club band was a focal point of attraction. The highlight of Singapore's social calendar was The Tanglin Ball. Even today, the ball is held yearly in the Churchill Room, an icon of the Club. Squash and tennis are also synonymous with The Tanglin Club. Before the fall of Singapore in February 1942, the Club was prepared for use as a convalescent depot for the Malayan Armed Service and an evacuee centre. During the Japanese occupation the Club was used as a Japanese officers' club. Having survived the vicissitudes of debt and war, age and apathy, even a major transformation, the Tanglin Club still retains an aura of exclusivity as one of the premier social clubs in Singapore today.Having grown from \"Forty Good Men\" to over 4,000 Members, the Club prides itself on itternational and cosmopolitan nature with more than 70 nationalities among its Members. It has earned a reputation of prestige and quality. the Tanglin Club Membership is still very much sought after as it offers excellent facilities and a distinguished lifestyle to its Members.The presidents of the Tanglin Club were persons of prominence such that there are many streets named after them, for instance, Dunman Road, Anderson Road & Bridge, Read Street & Bridge, Birch Road, Bishopsgate and Finlayson Green. The Tanglin Club today is an inviting oasis for relaxation and rejuvenation while its ambience still evokes the grace and charm of the past.",

    "description": "The Telok Blangah Archery Club (TBAC) appears to have existed in the early 2000s but by the mid 2000s, it was in kind of a â€śdecrepitâ€ť state. Thankfully (in 2005), two senior members of Telok Blangah Community Centre (now renamed as Telok Blangah Community Club), Mr Richard Yip and Mr Frankie Yat, got together and decided to do a total rejuvenation of the club. Its range was at a field next to the (now non-existent) Telok Blangah Primary School and a stone's throw from its present range for a fairly long time, until 2012 when it moved over. A funny thing was that its early members were somehow largely made up of retirees and fairly senior working people. The archery fraternity often teased that it was the Old Men's Archery Club. Soon, the teasing stopped when in under 2 years, the Club began to make a strong mark in local competitions. Indeed, we take pride that a significant number of our members are part of the Singapore National Archery Team and are also thankful for the continued support from the Telok Blangah Community Club. Several of the early members are still with the club. They include, of course, our two rejuvenators, Richard who is now the Advisor and â€śUncle Frankieâ€ť who is the Chairman as well as JL, our famed Mama cum National Archer cum Treasurer. Don Quixote and Decrepit who are now traditional bow archers with the Eagles sub-group were also early members of the club. For a bit of local history and trivia, the name â€śTelok Blangahâ€ť means â€śClay Pot Bayâ€ť in Malay. (Telok = Bay; Blangah = Clay pot or cauldron). The modern Malay spelling would be Teluk Belanga. Much of the area used to belong to the Yeo's Association and was the subject of land acquisition by the Singapore Government in the early 1970s, for the purpose of public housing. Due to it's proximity to the southern shore, Telok Blangah was designated as a resettlement housing estate for many island dwellers from the Southern islands. In fact, you could buy fresh sea catch from the early resettlement provision stores as the former islanders would still frequent their old fishing grounds. However, this practice stopped within a matter of years as access to the sea became more difficult and with the urbanization of the resettled communities. Today, the Yeo's Association (now called Hokkien Yeo See Association) still own about a 1+ hectare plot for their association building, just a few hops from our archery club.",

    "description": "The Japanese Association, Singapore was established more than a century ago in 1915 and reconstituted in 1957. The early objective of the Association was aimed at creating a mutual-aid group to look after one another's welfare, set up educational facilities, maintain the Japanese cemetery and promote global exchanges. Besides realizing its original intent, postwar Japanese Association has also been more active in promoting exchange and interactions with the Singapore community. Our new clubhouse is also designed to be culturally oriented to suit this purpose.One of the objectives of the Japanese Association is to become an international cultural exchange ground for people to meet, chat and relax. The new clubhouse, officially opened by Deputy Prime Minister BG (NS) Lee Hsien Loong on 23rd May 1998, is a building designed and constructed with a modern exterior while incorporating rich Japanese cultural flair in its interiors. Complemented by its excellent location along Adam Road, the clubhouse has a built-in area of nearly 8,000 square meters (4 times bigger than the previous location). On a freehold land size of approximately 5,600 square meters, the clubhouse has also been enhanced to provide members with improved services in a cosier setting and a much more pleasant environment. It is a clubhouse that can instil a sense of belonging and pride amongst its members. With a larger space available, we will be able to better organise our involvements with local charitable activities. More opportunities can also be created for cultural exchange and social interaction on a larger scale between our members and the different communities. At present we have approximately 4,401 Ordinary Members (Japanese nationals with voting rights) and 507 Associate Members. Only Associate memberships are transferable. We have 668 corporate members. (1 Jan 2025)",

The Club started with a 4-hole golf course and quickly expanded to feature a 9-hole golf course together with a driving range when it officially opened at Folkestone Road in 1962. Over the years, the Club progressed and it now has an 18-hole championship golf course as well as an extensive range of social and recreational facilities. Designed by Nelson & Haworth, the 18-hole championship golf course is a Par 71 with a maximum playing distance of 6234m. Located on the southern bank of the Kranji Reservoir, the scenic beauty of the golf course can be admired at a number of holes, where the reservoir forms the backdrop of the golf course, providing golfers with a breathtaking view during their play. Warren Golf & Country Club is only 40 minutes from Singapore Changi Airport.",
