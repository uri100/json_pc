The platform provides a well-rounded program in the club for its 775 members who come from all domains of our society. The image of a gentlemen as a human being, determined by an inner attitude, a certain lifestyle and a liberal and sovereign contact with other people, is our ideal. The decisive factor is not origin, but character. The Münchener Herrenclub e.V. does not see itself as a representation of interests or as a platform for professional advancement or network organization. The numerous events such as visits, lectures, museum visits and joint trips lead to a better acquaintance of the club members and provides friendships that last for a lifetime.",
