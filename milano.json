    "description": "Founded in Milan on May 28, 1841, the Circolo dell'Unione was established by 30 founding members, inspired by the social clubs they had encountered in Paris and London during their exile under Austrian rule. Led by prominent figures like Prince Emilio Barbiano di Belgiojoso d’Este and Giovanni Resta, the club aimed to unite Milan's nobility and bourgeoisie, promoting liberal ideals and social cohesion. In the 20th century, the club shifted focus from politics to social activities, adopting its current name, Circolo dell'Unione, in 1935. Today, it boasts around 650 members and maintains reciprocal agreements with nine Italian and eighteen international clubs, continuing its long tradition of fostering connection and camaraderie.",

    "description": "The Clubino (\"Clubino Dadi\") is a gentlemen's club in Milan founded in 1901 as a \"New Club\", Italianized in the New Circle, which later became Clubino, from a split of the Circle of the ancient Union meeting place of the Milanese aristocracy and bourgeoisie. The circle was strongly desired by the Milanese ruling class. The main promoters of the partnership were the engineer Giulio Ceretti, the cavalier Gerardo Maino and the engineer Carlo Vogel. Since 1928 the club has been located at the Casa degli Omenoni, and is considered among the most exclusive gentlemen's clubs in Italy, and includes among its members aristocratic and bourgeois families not only from Milan but also from other Italian cities, as , by its choice, the Clubino does not allow reciprocations with other clubs in Italy with the exception of the Circolo degli Scacchi in Rome and the Circolo del Whist in Turin. Its attendance is therefore allowed only to its members and to the members of foreign circles with which it has reciprocal relationships (among which the Knickerbocker of New York, the Boodle's of London.The Clubino is housed in the palace, dating back to the second half of the 16th century, known as the Casa degli Omenoni. It is located in Via Omenoni, in the center of Milan. The name of the building derives from the eight telamons (od Omoni), which characterize the facade, made by Antonio Abondio.",

    "description": "Milan sees the reopening of DO7 Eco Club House, a club dedicated to networking. A place to cultivate synergies and professional relations, a city lounge with a homely feel and Milanese flair, located in the picture-perfect Brera district, a stone’s throw from Milan city centre. The prestigious Hotel Milano Scala will also be home to a club house that takes its cue from the age-old English tradition of gentlemen’s clubs. This is indeed the inspiration behind the founding concept of DO7 Eco Club House, whose name offers a nod to the club’s strategic location in via Dell’Orso 7, as well as a playful allusion to the musical chord Do7, acknowledging the history (and position) of the hotel. The club aims to cater to those who come to Milan city centre regularly or who need the right location to meet clients or friends during the day. Professionals and business people, but also companies large or small looking for a venue guaranteed to impress, or simply a go-to place where they can develop business opportunities, but also enjoy some well-deserved leisure time. Alongside the services you’d expect of an English private members’ club – cloakroom and changing room, modular spaces for private meetings or corporate events, social tables for informal gatherings, events and evenings reserved for members – the Club offers hotel services such as a 24/7 reception, concierge services, bedrooms for daytime use and an automated garage. Networking will be high on the agenda for DO7 Eco Club House, with tailor-made activities and events designed to help members create and expand their networking contacts. Club members will be able to enjoy their leisure time by sipping a cocktail in the Lounge Bar, savouring one of the modern, sophisticated dishes served in the restaurant, or perhaps consulting the concierge for a tailor-made experience. The Club’s pičce de résistence will be the spectacular “Sky Terrace” rooftop garden, reserved exclusively for club patrons during the day and perfect for working breakfasts or lunches.",

    "description": "The Garden Society was founded in 1783 by a group of thirty-two Milanese citizens under the guidance of the Founding Member and first President, Francesco Bolchini. Initially the Club had the intention of entertainment and recreation, and then took on an increasingly cultural and institutional connotation. The Garden Society is one of the ten oldest Circles in the world, and has always remained active since its establishment, even during the wars of independence and the two world wars. The only documented period of closure was from February 6 to March 14, 1853, following the revolt in Milan that year. Many protagonists of Italian and international history have passed through the halls of the Societŕ del Giardino, both as Members and as Guests: kings, emperors, prime ministers, statesmen, cardinals, Nobel Prize winners, men of science, art and culture. The relationships with the Diplomatic Corps, with the Armed Forces, with the numerous Reciprocated Circles in Italy and abroad, and with the cultural institutions of the territory mean that the Societŕ del Giardino is today a point of reference for the city of Milan. The Societŕ del Giardino is a strictly apolitical Circle.",
