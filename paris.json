    "description": "The Automobile Club of France (ACF) is a men's club founded in 1895. The club still occupies more than 10,000 square meters in the Hotels du Plessis-Belličre and Moreau, both located between the Hôtel de Crillon and the Hôtel de Coislin, where France signed a treaty by which it became the first nation to recognize the independence of the United States. The members of the Automobile Club of France enjoy several lounges, a swimming pool, a gym, a library containing more than 50,000 references, a movie theatre, bars, and dining rooms. Numerous activities are offered, including yoga, squash, shooting, billiards, and fencing. The facilities also include a hair salon and a travel agency. From 1906 to 1914 the Club regulated major races in France and established the rules for the annual national race dubbed a Grand Prix that was open to competitors from any country. Today, the club maintains its head office and facilities on the Place de la Concorde in Paris.",

    "description": "A harbor of peace in the heart of Paris, with its magnificent salons, its splendid gardens, its contemporary sports complex, its quality cuisine and its rich century-old history, it helps maintain the art of fine living French-style and as a result, France's influence. The clubhouse is the Hôtel Perrinet de Jars at 33 rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré in Paris, France. It adjoins the British Embassy and an annex of the embassy of Japan. Because of its very central Paris address (a stone throw from the Place de la Concorde), its majestic interiors and its beautiful French gardens, the clubhouse is often considered as one of the most beautiful if not the most prestigious in France. The club's second president was Ferdinand Foch, Marshal of France, Field Marshal of the United Kingdom, Marshal of Poland and supreme commander of the Allies of World War I. The club includes royalty and political figures among its international members. The sports facility offers a 25m (5 lanes) swimming pool, squash courts, saunas, hammam, gym and training rooms, and is completed with a casual restaurant overlooking the swimming pool. A formal club dining room on the 1st floor and out in the garden during the summer months complete this club's amenities.",

They find an exclusive and discreet venue to hold their professional and private meetings, or to enjoy a meal. They meet at the Club during their visits and at events organized for them (tastings, presentations, conferences, themed dinners, etc.). They sometimes rub shoulders with travellers from around the globe who visit to discover the Parisian art de vivre. Members of the Saint James Club benefit from exceptional services and generous welcome that make the reputation of Relais & Châteaux properties. They also become part of a growing, informal community. The majestic residence hosting the Club began its life in 1892 on the site of Paris' first air-balloon landing field, as a home to the Thiers Foundation.",
