The Club offers its Members the opportunity to play Lawn Tennis, Padel, Real Tennis, Rackets and Squash on some of the finest courts in the world. An oasis of calm, The Queen’s Club is situated at a convenient location close to the centre of London. Along with first-class sporting facilities, the Club also offers excellent entertaining and dining facilities, including an elegant restaurant, bar, museum, and The President’s Room, all of which are located within the Members’ Clubhouse. The overall setting is both tranquil and charming. This, together with the array of racquet sports available, is why The Queen’s Club remains one of the most coveted memberships in the country. Throughout its history, the Club has been an exceptional sporting venue, and today hosts the world-famous annual HSBC Championships (formerly the cinch Championships), the World Rackets Championships, leading Real Tennis events, including the World Championship, the British Open and between 2009-2013 The ATCO Super Series Squash Finals. The Club has hosted as many as twenty-five different sporting activities and, as well as lawn tennis, has been the scene for such varied sports as ice-skating, baseball, athletics and rugby. By the late 1920s, annual Oxford v Cambridge challenges at rugby, football and athletics had taken place at the Club for over thirty years and, at times, as many as 10,000 spectators were attracted to the grounds. As these events outgrew the Club’s facilities, they were transferred to their new homes at Twickenham, Wembley and White City. Meanwhile, the increasingly popular game of lawn tennis took over the grounds of the Club. In May 2007 the Queen’s Club Members successfully acquired a 120-year lease from the Lawn Tennis Association. The Members now own and operate their Club through a fully elected Board and over recent years the Members have sensitively invested in the Club’s facilities completing key projects which include the Clubhouse refurbishment and the Grille, where Members dine in the heart of the Club, the creation of both a Junior Club facility and a new Gymnasium, re-surfaced four artificial grass courts and refurbished The President’s Room.",+44 20 7386 3400,,

The circle was strongly desired by the Milanese ruling class. The main promoters of the partnership were the engineer Giulio Ceretti, the cavalier Gerardo Maino and the engineer Carlo Vogel. Since 1928 the club has been located at the Casa degli Omenoni, and is considered among the most exclusive gentlemen's clubs in Italy, and includes among its members aristocratic and bourgeois families not only from Milan but also from other Italian cities, as , by its choice, the Clubino does not allow reciprocations with other clubs in Italy with the exception of the Circolo degli Scacchi in Rome and the Circolo del Whist in Turin. Its attendance is therefore allowed only to its members and to the members of foreign circles with which it has reciprocal relationships (among which the Knickerbocker of New York, the Boodle's of London.The Clubino is housed in the palace, dating back to the second half of the 16th century, known as the Casa degli Omenoni.

A place to cultivate synergies and professional relations, a city lounge with a homely feel and Milanese flair, located in the picture-perfect Brera district, a stone’s throw from Milan city centre. The prestigious Hotel Milano Scala will also be home to a club house that takes its cue from the age-old English tradition of gentlemen’s clubs. This is indeed the inspiration behind the founding concept of DO7 Eco Club House, whose name offers a nod to the club’s strategic location in via Dell’Orso 7, as well as a playful allusion to the musical chord Do7, acknowledging the history (and position) of the hotel. The club aims to cater to those who come to Milan city centre regularly or who need the right location to meet clients or friends during the day. Professionals and business people, but also companies large or small looking for a venue guaranteed to impress, or simply a go-to place where they can develop business opportunities, but also enjoy some well-deserved leisure time. Alongside the services you’d expect of an English private members’ club – cloakroom and changing room, modular spaces for private meetings or corporate events, social tables for informal gatherings, events and evenings reserved for members – the Club offers hotel services such as a 24/7 reception, concierge services, bedrooms for daytime use and an automated garage. Networking will be high on the agenda for DO7 Eco Club House, with tailor-made activities and events designed to help members create and expand their networking contacts. Club members will be able to enjoy their leisure time by sipping a cocktail in the Lounge Bar, savouring one of the modern, sophisticated dishes served in the restaurant, or perhaps consulting the concierge for a tailor-made experience.

The small port founded by Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles, the founder of Singapore, developed into a thriving trading centre, and the everyday life of the British settlement had become more sophisticated, and exclusively European. In October 1865, ""forty good men and true"" convened a meeting for the purpose of forming a suburban social club to meet the wants of the British living in the settlement, and founded the Tanglin Club. A property in the District of Claymore was purchased in 1866 and this is the current site of the Tanglin Club today. For many years, the Tanglin Club was one of the pillars of social life in Singapore for successful members of the European community. By the late 1930s, its ballroom had the reputation of having the best dance floor in the island and the Club band was a focal point of attraction. The highlight of Singapore's social calendar was The Tanglin Ball. Even today, the ball is held yearly in the Churchill Room, an icon of the Club. Squash and tennis are also synonymous with The Tanglin Club. Before the fall of Singapore in February 1942, the Club was prepared for use as a convalescent depot for the Malayan Armed Service and an evacuee centre. During the Japanese occupation the Club was used as a Japanese officers' club. Having survived the vicissitudes of debt and war, age and apathy, even a major transformation, the Tanglin Club still retains an aura of exclusivity as one of the premier social clubs in Singapore today.Having grown from ""Forty Good Men"" to over 4,000 Members, the Club prides itself on itternational and cosmopolitan nature with more than 70 nationalities among its Members. It has earned a reputation of prestige and quality. the Tanglin Club Membership is still very much sought after as it offers excellent facilities and a distinguished lifestyle to its Members.The presidents of the Tanglin Club were persons of prominence such that there are many streets named after them, for instance, Dunman Road, Anderson Road & Bridge, Read Street & Bridge, Birch Road, Bishopsgate and Finlayson Green.

Thankfully (in 2005), two senior members of Telok Blangah Community Centre (now renamed as Telok Blangah Community Club), Mr Richard Yip and Mr Frankie Yat, got together and decided to do a total rejuvenation of the club. Its range was at a field next to the (now non-existent) Telok Blangah Primary School and a stone's throw from its present range for a fairly long time, until 2012 when it moved over. A funny thing was that its early members were somehow largely made up of retirees and fairly senior working people. The archery fraternity often teased that it was the Old Men's Archery Club. Soon, the teasing stopped when in under 2 years, the Club began to make a strong mark in local competitions. Indeed, we take pride that a significant number of our members are part of the Singapore National Archery Team and are also thankful for the continued support from the Telok Blangah Community Club. Several of the early members are still with the club. They include, of course, our two rejuvenators, Richard who is now the Advisor and ""Uncle Frankie"" who is the Chairman as well as JL, our famed Mama cum National Archer cum Treasurer. Don Quixote and Decrepit who are now traditional bow archers with the Eagles sub-group were also early members of the club. For a bit of local history and trivia, the name ""Telok Blangah"" means ""Clay Pot Bay"" in Malay. (Telok = Bay; Blangah = Clay pot or cauldron). The modern Malay spelling would be Teluk Belanga. Much of the area used to belong to the Yeo's Association and was the subject of land acquisition by the Singapore Government in the early 1970s, for the purpose of public housing. Due to it's proximity to the southern shore, Telok Blangah was designated as a resettlement housing estate for many island dwellers from the Southern islands. In fact, you could buy fresh sea catch from the early resettlement provision stores as the former islanders would still frequent their old fishing grounds. However, this practice stopped within a matter of years as access to the sea became more difficult and with the urbanization of the resettled communities. Today, the Yeo's Association (now called Hokkien Yeo See Association) still own about a 1+ hectare plot for their association building, just a few hops from our archery club.",,,
