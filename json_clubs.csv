Cercle Munster,munster.lu,Luxembourg,"5-7 Rue Münster, 2160 Luxembourg",49.6086,6.135382,golf,"The Cercle Munster was founded in 1982 by a group of entrepreneurs who sought to create a Luxembourg club modeled on the Anglo-Saxon tradition of a Gentleman’s Club. In their view, the economic and social development of Luxembourg had reached a point that justified the creation of a top quality service that would attract corporate executives, senior partners and representatives of the international institutions as its members. Recruitment was, and still is, based on the model whereby a candidate member must be proposed and seconded by two existing Members, and subsequently approved by the Admissions Committee. The club has 10 private function rooms that can hold from 10 to 100 people. Members can choose to dine in the Brasserie where a variety of salads are served or try out the French cuisine featured in the gastronomic restaurant. Members can choose to accompany their meals with one of the 1500 different wines available. Other amenities include a Library and an English Bar.",+352 4706431,4.5,50

With 2 lounge bars, restaurant, terrace, meeting rooms with full video conferencing/private dining rooms, a games room and a small ventilated cigar room (the club is non smoking). A full active social and cultural events calendar all add up to providing a vibrant environment for members and guests.

The small port founded by Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles, the founder of Singapore, developed into a thriving trading centre, and the everyday life of the British settlement had become more sophisticated, and exclusively European. In October 1865, ""forty good men and true"" convened a meeting for the purpose of forming a suburban social club to meet the wants of the British living in the settlement, and founded the Tanglin Club. A property in the District of Claymore was purchased in 1866 and this is the current site of the Tanglin Club today. For many years, the Tanglin Club was one of the pillars of social life in Singapore for successful members of the European community. By the late 1930s, its ballroom had the reputation of having the best dance floor in the island and the Club band was a focal point of attraction. The highlight of Singapore's social calendar was The Tanglin Ball. Even today, the ball is held yearly in the Churchill Room, an icon of the Club. Squash and tennis are also synonymous with The Tanglin Club. Before the fall of Singapore in February 1942, the Club was prepared for use as a convalescent depot for the Malayan Armed Service and an evacuee centre.

Telok Blangah Archery Club,eaglesoftbac.wordpress.com,Singapore,"80 Telok Blangah Street 31, Singapore 100080",1.273697,103.80716,archery,"The Telok Blangah Archery Club (TBAC) appears to have existed in the early 2000s but by the mid 2000s, it was in kind of a “decrepit” state. Thankfully (in 2005), two senior members of Telok Blangah Community Centre (now renamed as Telok Blangah Community Club), Mr Richard Yip and Mr Frankie Yat, got together and decided to do a total rejuvenation of the club. Its range was at a field next to the (now non-existent) Telok Blangah Primary School and a stone’s throw from its present range for a fairly long time, until 2012 when it moved over. A funny thing was that its early members were somehow largely made up of retirees and fairly senior working people. The archery fraternity often teased that it was the Old Men’s Archery Club. Soon, the teasing stopped when in under 2 years, the Club began to make a strong mark in local competitions. Indeed, we take pride that a significant number of our members are part of the Singapore National Archery Team and are also thankful for the continued support from the Telok Blangah Community Club. Several of the early members are still with the club. They include, of course, our two rejuvenators, Richard who is now the Advisor and “Uncle Frankie” who is the Chairman as well as JL, our famed Mama cum National Archer cum Treasurer. Don Quixote and Decrepit who are now traditional bow archers with the Eagles sub-group were also early members of the club. For a bit of local history and trivia, the name “Telok Blangah” means “Clay Pot Bay” in Malay. (Telok = Bay; Blangah = Clay pot or cauldron). The modern Malay spelling would be Teluk Belanga. Much of the area used to belong to the Yeo’s Association and was the subject of land acquisition by the Singapore Government in the early 1970s, for the purpose of public housing. Due to it’s proximity to the southern shore, Telok Blangah was designated as a resettlement housing estate for many island dwellers from the Southern islands. In fact, you could buy fresh sea catch from the early resettlement provision stores as the former islanders would still frequent their old fishing grounds. However, this practice stopped within a matter of years as access to the sea became more difficult and with the urbanization of the resettled communities.
