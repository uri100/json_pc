Within the magnificent premises of the National Liberal Club in Whitehall, we provide a home from home for writers, editors, agents and all those professionally engaged with literature and the publishing industry. The Club is a space where members can gather for informal drinks, dinner, and to socialise, work or study. Our monthly lunches provide a unique opportunity to hear acclaimed authors discuss their latest work within an intimate gathering – recent guest speakers have included Timothy Garton Ash, Linda Grant, Guy Gunaratne, Blake Morrison, Miranda Seymour and Anne Sebba. A lively programme of evening events includes readings, discussions and dinners. Recent speakers have included Andrey Kurkov, Leila Aboulela and Kim Sherwood. The Club also supports the best in contemporary writing though its literary prizes: the Best First Novel Award and the Stanford Dolman Award for travel writing.",

Prince Philip would dine twice with the club. The refounded club now has regular meetings at the Savile Club and the Oriental Club and has recently resumed its traditional annual activities, including a snooker match and cricket match with the Savile Club. The revived club has registered the words \"Eccentric Club\", \"Nil Nisi Bonum\" and the old club logo as own trademarks.",

    "description": "Established in 1886, The Queen’s Club was the first multipurpose sports complex ever to be built, anywhere in the world. The Club offers its Members the opportunity to play Lawn Tennis, Padel, Real Tennis, Rackets and Squash on some of the finest courts in the world. An oasis of calm, The Queen’s Club is situated at a convenient location close to the centre of London. Along with first-class sporting facilities, the Club also offers excellent entertaining and dining facilities, including an elegant restaurant, bar, museum, and The President’s Room, all of which are located within the Members’ Clubhouse. The overall setting is both tranquil and charming. This, together with the array of racquet sports available, is why The Queen’s Club remains one of the most coveted memberships in the country. Throughout its history, the Club has been an exceptional sporting venue, and today hosts the world-famous annual HSBC Championships (formerly the cinch Championships), the World Rackets Championships, leading Real Tennis events, including the World Championship, the British Open and between 2009-2013 The ATCO Super Series Squash Finals. The Club has hosted as many as twenty-five different sporting activities and, as well as lawn tennis, has been the scene for such varied sports as ice-skating, baseball, athletics and rugby. By the late 1920s, annual Oxford v Cambridge challenges at rugby, football and athletics had taken place at the Club for over thirty years and, at times, as many as 10,000 spectators were attracted to the grounds. As these events outgrew the Club’s facilities, they were transferred to their new homes at Twickenham, Wembley and White City. Meanwhile, the increasingly popular game of lawn tennis took over the grounds of the Club. In May 2007 the Queen’s Club Members successfully acquired a 120-year lease from the Lawn Tennis Association. The Members now own and operate their Club through a fully elected Board and over recent years the Members have sensitively invested in the Club’s facilities completing key projects which include the Clubhouse refurbishment and the Grille, where Members dine in the heart of the Club, the creation of both a Junior Club facility and a new Gymnasium, re-surfaced four artificial grass courts and refurbished The President’s Room.",
